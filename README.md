# Set-IP

As i have to manualy change network adapter settings quite often i wrote this powershell functions to be able to easily change adapter settings in "lazy" syntax (minimum typing).

I personally use conemu and load this function with my psprofile. For changing of adapter settings run powershell with admin privileges.
I run powershell v5 - but is think it should work with powershell >= v3.
